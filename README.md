Join the AI CoP community as Udaya Patnaik, Chief Innovation Officer for the IT Category (ITC) in the Federal Acquisition Service, provides an overview of the Generative AI and Specialized Computing Infrastructure Acquisition Resource Guide. 


Executive Order 14110 on Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence directed the General Services Administration (GSA) to facilitate access to Federal Government-wide acquisition solutions for commercial AI capabilities. 


GSA recently published the Generative AI and Specialized Computing Infrastructure Acquisition Resource Guide to help the acquisition workforce understand the basics of Generative AI and considerations when procuring Generative AI solutions.


Created as v1.0, the guide provides an overview of basic AI concepts for the acquisition community, offers questions that contracting officials should ask in the process, suggests actions that can help agency teams get to better solutions faster and gives snapshots of different acquisition vehicles and methods that agencies can use when attempting to buy Generative AI solutions.


This will be a virtual event through Zoom for Government. Live captioning is available to all participants. Please register in advance to attend the event with a .gov or .mil email address. This event is open to federal employees only. Once youâ€™ve registered, ZoomGov will send you a link to join the session.
